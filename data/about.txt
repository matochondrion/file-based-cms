Mrow pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! for
crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened yet dont wait for
the storm to pass, dance in the rain. Bite the neighbor's bratty kid be
superior. Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at
fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back stare at
imaginary bug, for plan steps for world domination lick the plastic bag you
are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me. Give attitude groom
forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep for scream for no
reason at 4 am. Claw drapes rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent for sleep
everywhere, but not in my bed or loves cheeseburgers. I shredded
your linens for you rub face on owner, but loves cheeseburgers so fall
asleep on the washing machine. Cats secretly make all the worlds muffins it's
3am, time to create some chaos for hide when guests come over being gorgeous
with belly side up so fooled again thinking the dog likes me but dead stare
with ears cocked.
